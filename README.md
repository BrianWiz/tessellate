# Verkaboot Tessellate - A hi-res tileset creation tool

Tessellate intends to fill a gap that exists in art tools around the creation of tilesets and 2D level design. From 9-slice UI design to complex isometric angled tiles with layering and animation, most tools are too limited. Because they are either art programs or level-design tools, the feedback between the art and the function of the tiles as level-design tools is cumbersome. Tessellate will link the creation of tiles with level-design tools to supply immediate feedback on tiles in their context and make it easy to identify when there are missing transitions, all with the digital painting tools required to make high resolution art.
